# Custom_NotePad
In this project I have created a custom notepad whose main Highlight is custom "Find and replace" Widget Which is built from scratch. Along with Font display window.


Highlights:

 1.You can select the text in main window you want to search and it will automatically update text in your Find Widget. As shown in second screenshot.

2. If you find the same text further down the document when pressed Find Next, it will automatically show the selection in MainWindow TextEdit Widget.


Some Examples of this code.
